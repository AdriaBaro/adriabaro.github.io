## Danfoss solenoid valves product program

### DESCRIPTION
This project was the core of the *Technology, Platforms and Architectures* course, at a MSc level. This course provided the tools and knowledge to correctly analyse a product assortment (platforms, architectures, configurators, knowledge-, data-, and product life management systems). Also, to identify goals for platform and architecture improvement. All the knowledge was tried to be applied in this real project.

### OBJECTIVES
The project was divided into two differentiated parts, each one having its objectives.
The first part main objective was to analyze the current [Danfoss](https://www.danfoss.com/en/) product program for the solenoid valves and identify improvement areas and goals for the future.
The second part aimed to propose a new product program based on the identified goals.

### METHODOLOGY
#### PART 1: What can Danfoss product program be improved?
The first part of the project consisted of a deep investigation of Danfoss current product program (market, valves design, production, sales, etc.). After having the right understanding, three posters were elaborated to provide an overview of what Danfoss was offering, to whom and how. The first poster consisted on a Product Family Master Plan (PFMP), showing the link between customer needs and the engineering part of the solenoid valves.
