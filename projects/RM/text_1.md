## Design of a torque-limiting spanner

### DESCRIPTION

The project was part of the course *Strength of Materials* in which the fundamentals of materials' elasticity and resistance were studied and applied. Even though finite element methods (FEM) was the core of the project, it also included material selection, design optimization and prototyping. 

### OBJECTIVES

The main objective of the project was to design and prototype a torque-limiting spanner, complying some important restrictions.  Secondary objectives were to minimize the weight and use the right material as well as the process to manufacture the prototype.
### METHODOLOGY

The project started with some research on the spanner dimensioning, regulations, materials and manufacturing processes. The main steps and the tools used are summarized below:


##### MATERIAL SELECTION

The material needed to fulfil several specifications, i.e. having a suitable Young's modulus or being recyclable. Other properties such as the price, isotropy or manufacturability were also considered. To choose the most appropriate material for the spanner, CES EduPack software was used.  As it is shown in *Fig.1*, the software showed the best materials which fulfilled all the requirements.

After several considerations and talking with different companies, Aluminium T651 was choosen.

##### CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN
This part started with a preliminary design which complied with the design solicitations, see *Fig.2.*

This first design was modelled and analyzed using ANSYS, one of the most popular FEM programmes. Once the suitable analysis configuration was set (boundary conditions, mesh and forces), the results were obtained. The analyzed results were the displacement, stress distributions and Von Mises stresses, see *Fig.3* as an example.

### CONSTRUCTION AND RESULTS

The final design of the torque-limiting spanner was protoyped. It was manufactured using a water jet cutting machine, thanks to the company <a href="https://www.aalco.es/" target="_blank"> AMARI METALS IBERICA, S.L.</a> that accepted to collaborate with the project. The prototype can be observed in *Fig.6.*.

Finally, the protoype was tested in the lab to validate all the previous work. The spanner failed at the specified torque during the failure test, proving that the design process and calculations were correct.

### THE TEAM
This project was performed with two fellow students of the same bachelor. Each of us was involved in all the parts. 
The members of the team were:
Daniel López Mariblanca
David Fructuoso Keller
