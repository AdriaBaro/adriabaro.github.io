### DESCRIPTION
The project was the main focus of the *Construction Systems* course.  In this course, the most used construction techniques for industrial buildings were studied. Also, how to correctly make construction drawings using AutoCAD and to plan and design an industrial building.

### OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the project were to apply some construction techniques in a self-designed industrial building.
The planned industrial building had to have a realistic production purpose, be placed in an existing parcel of land and comply with the planning restrictions of the Municipality. Doing a structural analysis was not part of the project, however, the structure had to be down-to-earth and functional.
