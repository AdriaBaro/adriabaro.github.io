## Design of a torque-limiting spanner

### DESCRIPTION
The project was part of the course *Continuum Mechanics* in which the fundamentals of materials' elasticity and resistance were studied and applied. The project combined 
### OBJECTIVES

The main objective of the project was to design and prototype a torque-limiting spanner, complying some important restrictions.  Secondary objectives were to minimize the weight and use the right material to manufacture it.
