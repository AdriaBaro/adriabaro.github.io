## Design of a torque-limiting spanner

### DESCRIPTION

The project was part of the course *Continuum Mechanics* in which the fundamentals of materials' elasticity and resistance were studied and applied. The project included material selection, finite element methods (FEM), design optimization and prototyping.

### OBJECTIVES

The main objective of the project was to design and prototype a torque-limiting spanner, complying some important restrictions.  Secondary objectives were to minimize the weight and use the right material and process to manufacture it.

### METHODOLOGY
The project started with some research on the spanner dimensioning, regulations, materials and manufacturing processes. The main steps and the tools used are summarized below:
