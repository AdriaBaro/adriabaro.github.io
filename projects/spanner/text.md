## Design of a torque-limiting spanner

### DESCRIPTION

The project was part of the course *Continuum Mechanics* in which the fundamentals of materials' elasticity and resistance were studied and applied. Even thogh finite element methods (FEM) was the core of the project, it also included material selection, design optimization and prototyping. 

### OBJECTIVES

The main objective of the project was to design and prototype a torque-limiting spanner, complying some important restrictions.  Secondary objectives were to minimize the weight and use the right material and process to manufacture it.

### METHODOLOGY
The project started with some research on the spanner dimensioning, regulations, materials and manufacturing processes. The main steps and the tools used are summarized below:

##### MATERIAL SELECTION
The material needed to fulfil several specifications, i.e. having a suitable Young's modulus or being recyclable. Other properties such as the price, isotropy or manufacturability were also considered. To choose the most appropriate material for the spanner, CES EduPack software was used.  As it is shown in *Fig.1*, the software showed the best materials which fulfilled all the requirements.

After several considerations and talking with different companies, Aluminium T651 was choosen.

##### FEM
This part started with a preliminary design which complied with the design solicitations, see *Fig.2.*
