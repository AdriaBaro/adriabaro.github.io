## Wood skis optimization through the virtualization of experimental essays
### DESCRIPTION
This project was the thesis for the BSc in Industrial Engineering. It was carried out in collaboration with [Liken Skis](https://www.likenskis.com/en/), a start-up that designs and manufactures high-performance and handcrafted wood skis. The thesis was supervised by [Xavier Ayneto Gubert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xayneto/),  a well-known senior professor at UPC with 40+ years of experience.

### OBJECTIVES
The main objective of the project was to define and work with a methodology to optimize a wood skis model. The optimization intended to reduce its weight without performance or features loss.
Secondary goals of the project were to execute lab tests, apply design of experiments (DOE) and virtualize experimental essays using FEM-analysis.
